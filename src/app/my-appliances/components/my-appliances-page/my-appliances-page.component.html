                This page is a log of the appliances you have launched.

                    Each log entry keeps key appliance and instance
                    information, also giving you a link to access a web
                    interface that the given appliance may offer. This log is
                    kept forever. <br/>
                    Note that you cannot shut down or delete any instances from
                    this page but need to use the appliance or the cloud
                    provider interface instead. Even after an appliance has
                    been shut down, its access URL will remain visible here.
